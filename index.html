	   <h3>Projects</h3>
	   <p>Simple Calculator: Calculator that can compute basic operations such as multiplication, division, addition, subtraction, along with commands
		like clear and backspace. This project was important for me to brush up on my HTML/CSS skills, especially for the clean user interface and gif
		background, which are optimized for a native resolution.</p>
	   <p>Web Weather App: Weather app that displays the current temperature, humidity, and wind speed of a certain city/location. I used the OpenWeather API to retrieve weather information based on location.</p>
	   <p>Discord Bot: Created a discord bot that can play music and perform silly commands. This was my first Node.js project, got to learn the basics of it, as well as how to use the discord API to create a functional discord
		bot.</p>
